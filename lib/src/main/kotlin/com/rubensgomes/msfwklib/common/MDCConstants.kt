/**
 * Constants for MDC (Mapped Diagnostic Context) key-value pairs used throughout the framework.
 *
 * This object contains predefined keys for storing contextual information in the SLF4J MDC, which
 * enables consistent logging across the application with request-scoped data.
 *
 * The MDC keys defined here are used by various framework components including:
 * - Request filters for populating context from HTTP headers or request body
 * - Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) advice for automatic MDC population
 * - Filters for clearing MDC context at the end of request processing
 *
 * Usage examples:
 * ```kotlin
 * // Setting values in MDC
 * MDC.put(MDCConstants.CLIENT_ID_KEY, "client123")
 * MDC.put(MDCConstants.TRANSACTION_ID_KEY, "txn456")
 *
 * // Retrieving values from MDC
 * val clientId = MDC.get(MDCConstants.CLIENT_ID_KEY)
 * val transactionId = MDC.get(MDCConstants.TRANSACTION_ID_KEY)
 *
 * // Iterating over all supported keys
 * MDCConstants.MDC_KEYS.forEach { key ->
 *     val value = MDC.get(key)
 *     if (!value.isNullOrBlank()) {
 *         println("$key: $value")
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
